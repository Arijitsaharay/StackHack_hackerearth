We are building and designing a web-application that organizes events all around the globe both online and offline. It arranges tickets for events and sends notifications to the registered guests about any upcoming events. Our all in one technocrat application is a simple web-application where users are needed to log in to get information. Once logged in the person can go to the events tab to select events of their choice and to selection a registration form comes out which on submission generates an auto-generated unique id representing the ticket number of the participant along with an auto-generated mail to their email confirming their registration. After that the web-application views only the ticket of the participant and notifies them about the eventâ€™s approach. It also has a 24x7 a.I. Generated chatbot service that hears the questions of the users and comes to their aid. The chatbot also notify the users regarding any upcoming events and how to register for it.

This is a website which is made using PHP, Javascript, html, css, mysql. A zip file has been provided above. A mydb.sql page is given there open phpmyadmin, give database name -> mydb and import that file. See the above YouTube video for more information.
